Demand Forecasting is an important area for business and country alike. Energy demand is increasing due to an increase in technological advancement. It is a need of time to tackle climate with machine learning. Therefore, for this project the dataset is chosen from “ Entsoe ANDOpenweather”. 

Dataset is taken from this website and it contains 35064 rows and 29 columns. The dataset has 4 years of electrical consumption, generation, pricing and weather data for spain. The links are given in references. The dataset has hourly data for electrical consumption and respective forecasts by Transmission Service Operators (TSO) such as Spanish esios Red Electric Espana (REE) for consumption and pricing.

The problem being considered for the project is to predict or forecast energy demand
accurately in Spain. The research questions considered for this project are: 
1. Which regression technique will accurately forecast the daily energy consumption demand using hourly period ? 
2.How to accurately forecast energy demand 24 hours in advance compared to TSO? 
3. Using Classification, determine what weather measurement and cities influence most the electric demand, prices, and generation capacity? 

The tools that will be used are Python jupyter, Tableau, R, Excel and others as needed.
The systematic data analysis process approach will be used for the project. 

After date selection, initial analysis will be carried out followed by the exploratory analysis (EDA). Then experimental design and model building will be carried out. Finally performance evaluation will be done together with recommendations and conclusions.
